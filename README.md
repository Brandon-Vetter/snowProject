# snowProject
a device that detect the level of the snow
The device uses mass, temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure to figure out snow depth.
Currently it is just collecting snow data and sending it to a google sheet.
I plan to use this data to add a formula into the project in the future that figures out the snow depth from the data I have collected.
The code is not commented, it is just a backup for myself.
You are welcome to fork it or look through it if you like, its just kinda a mess.
